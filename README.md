#KNN-RandiomSubSampling-KFold

Repository contains implimentation of K-nearest neighbour (kNN) classifier (a baby first step into the world of data classification!) on three different daatasets and Visualization of Decision boundary generated by KNN classifier (for two features from IRIS dataset).


----------
Datasets are collected from the UCI Machine learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)

To run the scripts in code/Random subsampling, code/Kfold directory and code/decisionboundar.py keep the .py file and datasets in the same directory.
